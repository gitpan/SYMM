=head1 NAME

RealPix.pm - Perl extension for dynamic generation of RealPix files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SYMM::RN::RealPix;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an object oriented interface to generation of 
RealPix files, a datatype which plays within the RealPlayer from 
RealNetworks since version 6.0 (G2)
    
 use SYMM::RN::RealPix;
 $s = new RealPix;
 $s->addMedia( "src" => "rtsp://videoserver.com/video.rm" );
 print $s->getAsString();

This will create the following SMIL file:

 <smil>
    <body>
        <par>
            <ref src="rtsp://videoserver.com/video.rm"/>
        </par>
    </body>
 </smil>

Your first SMIL file!  Actually, this doesn't do much, but smil beginners 
can't be chosers, right?

You can do more advanced things by adding regions to your SMIL files, and
playing media inside those regions.

    use Smil;
    $s = new Smil( "height" => 300, "width" => 300 );
    $region_name = "first_region";
    $s->addRegion( "name" => $region_name, 
		   "top" => 20, "left" => 35, 
		   "height" => 100, "width" => 100 );
    $s->addMedia( "src" => "rtsp://videoserver.com/video.rm",
              "region" => $region_name );
    print $s->getAsString;

This code results in the following output:

 <smil>
    <head>
        <layout>
            <root-layout width="300" 
                         height="300"/>
            <region width="100" 
                    height="100" 
                    left="35" 
                    top="20" 
                    id="first_region"/>
        </layout>
    </head>
    <body>
        <par>
            <ref src="rtsp://videoserver.com/video.rm" 
                 region="first_region"/>
        </par>
    </body>
 </smil>

(Well, sort of, I had to reformat it so that it didn't stretch past the
end of the line, but functionally exactly the same)

All of this would be somewhat trivial if this module didn't expose the 
main differentiator between SMIL and HTML -- the timeline!  With SMIL
you can synchronize and schedule your media over a timeline, all 
without nasty proprietary scripting solutions.  This idea is built into 
SMIL and exposed in this module.

 use Smil;
 $s = new Smil( "height" => 300, "width" => 300 );
 $region1 = "first_region";
 $region2 = "second_region";
 $s->addRegion( "name" => $region1, 
		"top" => 20, "left" => 35, 
		"height" => 100, "width" => 100 );
 $s->addRegion( "name" => $region2, 
		"top" => 60, "left" => 55, 
		"height" => 120, "width" => 120 );
 $s->startSequence();
 $s->addMedia( "src" => "rtsp://videoserver.com/video1.rm",
	       "region" => $region1 );
 $s->addMedia( "src" => "rtsp://videoserver.com/video2.rm",
	       "region" => $region2 );
 $s->endSequence();
 print $s->getAsString;

Results in this (again formatted to fit your screen...)

 <smil>
    <head>
        <layout>
            <root-layout width="300" height="300"/>
            <region width="100" height="100" 
                    left="35" top="20" 
                    id="first_region"/>
            <region width="120" height="120" 
                    left="55" top="60" 
                    id="second_region"/>
        </layout>
    </head>
    <body>
        <seq>
            <ref src="rtsp://videoserver.com/video1.rm" 
                    region="first_region"/>
            <ref src="rtsp://videoserver.com/video2.rm" 
                    region="second_region"/>
        </seq>
    </body>
 </smil>

You can schedule media in two ways, by calling startSequence coupled with 
endSequence or startParallel with endParallel, as you saw above, 
or you can specify begin and end times within the media directly for 
an absolute timeline.  

 use Smil;
 $s = new Smil( "height" => 300, "width" => 300 );
 $region1 = "first_region";
 $region2 = "second_region";
 $s->addRegion( "name" => $region1, 
		"top" => 20, "left" => 35, 
		"height" => 100, "width" => 100 );
 $s->addRegion( "name" => $region2, 
		"top" => 60, "left" => 55, 
		"height" => 120, "width" => 120 );
 $s->startParallel();
 $s->addMedia( "src" => "rtsp://videoserver.com/video1.rm",
	       "region" => $region1 );
 $s->addMedia( "src" => "rtsp://videoserver.com/video1.rm",
	       "region" => $region2,
	       "begin" => "5s" );
 $s->endParallel();
 print $s->getAsString();

Producing this:

 <smil>
    <head>
        <layout>
            <root-layout width="300" height="300"/>
            <region width="100" height="100" 
                    left="35" top="20" id="first_region"/>
            <region width="120" height="120" 
                    left="55" top="60" id="second_region"/>
        </layout>
    </head>
    <body>
        <par>
            <ref src="rtsp://videoserver.com/video1.rm" 
                 region="first_region"/>
            <ref src="rtsp://videoserver.com/video1.rm" 
                 region="second_region" begin="5s"/>
        </par>
    </body>
 </smil>

Notice the "begin" parameter, this tells the media its absolute begin time.
The above code will start the second clip 5 seconds after the first even
though they are playing in parallel

Like HTML, SMIL applications can have hyperlinks.  There are two types in 
SMIL: normal hrefs, and anchors.  An href covers the entire media item, 
whereas an anchor covers a rectangular portion of the media item.  To create
an href, add the "href" parameter when you add the media to the 
SMIL object.

 $s->addMedia( "src" => "rtsp://videosource.com/video.rm",
               "show" => "new",
               "href" => "http://www.destinationlink.com/link.html" );

Adding anchors is more complex, but much more versatile.  You can do 
everything with anchors that you can do with hrefs, but with anchors
you add the capability to change the hyperlinks over time and specify
only portions of the media item for linking.  To create an anchor
you need to pass, brace yourself, a reference to an array of hash references.
Mimic the code below if you don't want to know what that means.  The format 
is like this:

[ { hash_values }, { hash_values } ] where hash_values are key-value
pairs like "bob" => "sally"  (Perl gurus know that "=>" is a synonym for
comma...)

Here's a code example to get you started.

    $smil->addMedia( 'src' => "video.rm",
		     'anchors' => 
                        [ 
                          { 'href' => "http://websrv.com/index.html, 
                              'coords' => '0,0,110,50',
			      'show' => 'new',
			      'begin' => 3 } ,
                          { 'href' => "another.smil",
			      'coords' => '125,208,185,245',
			      'begin' => 9 } 
                        ] );

Notice several things about the above example.  One, with an anchor, we
can specify where we want the hyperlink to persist over the media item.  
This is done using a coordinate system with two points, the top, left 
corner, and the bottom, right corner.  So, if we wanted to remove the 
href tag completely, we could just specify the entire canvas of the media
item in the coordinate parameter and we would have the same thing as a href.
Also, in the above example, we started some hyperlinks at different times.
The first one begins a 3 seconds, and the second begins at 9 seconds.  We
could have also specified end times using the "end" parameter/attribute.
Finally, since a SMIL is not HTML we have to have a mechanism for dealing
with links to HTML files (or other media for that matter) and media that
can play back within our SMIL player.  So, if we want to send the result
of clicking on a link to a web browser, we need to use the "show" parameter
and give it a value of "new".  If we want our SMIL player to handle the
hyperlink itself (as would be the case for the second example since it is
another smil file), we can either leave the "show" parameter out and let 
it default to the SMIL player, or explicitly add "show" => "replace" to
replace the current SMIL file with the new link.
