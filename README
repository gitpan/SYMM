WHAT IS THIS?

The Smil.pm module.  This module provides an interface for generating 
SMIL files using perl.  SMIL is a W3C langauge for multi-media authoring.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

Installation of this module should be as simple as copying the entire
directory tree 'SYMM' into your perl lib directory.  On my RedHat 5.1 
distribution this means, after unzipping and untarring, I use this command:

'cp -R SYMM /usr/lib/perl5/'

Or, you could add a symbolic link using this command:

'ln -s /install/dir/SYMM /usr/lib/perl5/SYMM'

This only works on OSes which support symlinks, on other OS you will have to
copy the directory.  

If you don't have adminstrator/root access on the machine you want to 
install it on, you will have to modify your @INC variable, which is where
perl searches for modules like this one.  You can do one of two things within
your perl scripts:

use lib '/install/path/';
use SYMM::Smil;

OR

BEGIN { unshift @INC, '/install/path/'; }

Either one of these commands will allow you to use the module, provided
you fill in the correct path for '/install/path/'

WHAT SYSTEMS DOES IT WORK WITH?

I have tested it on several Linux distributions and ActiveState Perl for
Win32.  The module is pure perl, so it should work with any standard
perl distribution.  If it doesn't, please email me and tell me your problem.

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

Run 'perldoc SYMM::Smil'  If you haven't installed it correctly, you will 
have to perpend the installation directory to the front of the module
name.

WHERE ARE THE EXAMPLES?

I have provided a few examples within the perldoc documentation.  It is 
a top priority for me to add these to the web page for perlysmil, which 
is here:

I'll try to add more to this soon.

Hope this helps you with MM authoring.
